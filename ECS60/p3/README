The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your huffman.cpp source code.
The test runs your program on three files, and compares various aspects of your
output with those aspects of my output.
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
